    # These steps are created as every job requires to run the code successfully.
    # Ex. Add tasks outside of main.py so we can execute the code such as installing the packages.
    # then no need to add tasks like 'read data' since it is a part of main.py
    # Other possible tasks can be testing, deployment, quality control etc.
    # If added more python files like read.py write.py that are run in main.py, we don't need to add these files in the steps.
